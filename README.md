### My Process
- Design the Desktop Viewport WHILE desinging the Mobile viewport at the same time
- Design the flex/grid system, making sure to have both Desktop and Mobile Viewport layout correct
- Add in all the other HTML content
- Finished up all the initial static CSS designs
- Add in the hover and focus CSS states
- Add JS functions to the pre-determine tip buttons and custom tip input
- Add JS to make calculations everytime an input is made
- Add JS to make the reset buttons change (there is 2 reset buttons overlaying one another)
- Add JS for the reset button
- Add JS to prevent user from using the - and + keys
- Final testings before deployment

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I Learned
- More Flexbox
- Flex-wrap trick - to make row into columns on smaller viewports (depeding on element's width)
- Flex and margin-top:auto trick - to make the reset button always be on bottom of the flex
- Always use vh/vw as a starting point, then %width and %height then use rem units on smaller things
